This is an exam project made for the course DM844 Web Development with Groovy and Grails at IMADA, University of Southern Denmark. The project is made in colaboration with 2 co-students.

### Business idea: ###

The goal of this project is to build a simple webshop consisting of a backend
for employees, and a frontend for customers.

The backend is used to assign product orders to employees that are suited for 
handling specific (parts of) orders, and completeing them.

The frontend must allow users to select products and make orders.

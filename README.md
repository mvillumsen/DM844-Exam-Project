### Business idea: ###

The goal of this project is to build a simple webshop consisting of a backend
for employees, and a frontend for customers.

The backend is used to assign product orders to employees that are suited for 
handling specific (parts of) orders, and completeing them.

The frontend must allow users to select products and make orders.

## Info
Not that the project is not online anymore!

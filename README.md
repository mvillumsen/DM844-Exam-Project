#### GROUP 05

This project is for the course DM844 at SDU.

### Business idea: ###

The goal of this project is to build a simple webshop consisting of a back-end
for employees, and a front end for customers.

The back-end is used to assign product orders to employees that are suited for 
handling specific (parts of) orders, and completeing them.

The front-end must allow users to select products and make orders.
